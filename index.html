            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Purushothaman Manivannan. I am currently a PhD Research Scholar at the <strong>University of Antwerp</strong>, working in the <strong>Computational Materials Modeling (COMMIT) Lab</strong> under the supervision of <strong>Dr. Cem Sevik</strong>. My research focuses on excitonic calculations and the modeling of 2D materials using advanced computational techniques.</p>
            <p>Previously, I spent two wonderful years as a Junior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://lnkd.in/dWeZu9rw" target="_blank">Materials Modeling and Simulation Laboratory</a> at IIITDM Kancheepuram, working under the guidance of <strong>Dr. Debolina Misra</strong>. During this time, I developed strong expertise in computational materials science, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies of correlated oxide materials.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My experience includes working with DFT functionals (including GGA-PBE) and the DFT+U method within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to accurately compute electronic structures. I have optimized optical and transport properties in strongly correlated oxides to develop cost-effective transparent conducting materials.</p>
            <p>One of my key projects involved investigating the effect of biaxial strain and transition-metal doping (3d, 4d, 5d series) on the optoelectronic properties of the gapped metallic oxide SrVO<sub>3</sub>. This work identified the potential of SrVO<sub>3</sub> as a promising candidate for indium-free transparent conductors.</p>
            <p>As part of my initial introduction at University of Antwerp, I delivered a seminar titled <strong>"Empirical DFT Analysis of d-Orbital Band Engineering in Gapped Metallic Oxide SrVO₃"</strong>, where I presented my findings and received valuable feedback from the COMMIT team.</p>
            <p>Beyond DFT calculations, I also extensively use Python for post-processing and visualizing VASP outputs, utilizing tools such as VASPKIT and BoltzTraP. I have also worked on d-band center analysis for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reactions, broadening my research exposure.</p>
